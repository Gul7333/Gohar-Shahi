      <title>The Return of Jesus: Jesus Christ meets Gohar Shahi in America</title>
      <link>https://gohar-shahi.com/articles/jesusreturn</link>
      <description>On 29th May 1997, I was at the El Monte Lodge in Taos, New Mexico. During the second half of the night, I felt the presence of a man in my room. There was not enough light, so at first I thought it was one of my followers.I asked him, ‘Why have you come?’ the man replied, ‘I have come to see you.’ I turned on the light and I saw a handsome young man standing before me, whom I did not know. Seeing him, I felt immense energy and spiritual ecstasy in my soul and spiritual entities, a similar spiritual ecstasy that I would feel and experience in the gathering of the ‘Higher Realms’.
    I learnt that he could speak many languages. The young man told me, ‘I am Jesus (Son of Mary); I am in America, presently.’ I asked him, ‘Where do you live?’ he replied, ‘I neither had a home in the past nor now.’</description>

      <title>Teachings of His Eminence Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</title>
      <link>https://gohar-shahi.com/articles/Teaching</link>
      <description>Teachings of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi are profound, unique, and straightforward. The essence of his message is: Awaken your heart's spirit and connect with God through it. When the heart chants the name of God, God’s love automatically enters the heart, filling it with divine light and serenity.
    As the heartbeats get prominent, try to synchronise ‘Allah Allah’ with every beat or ‘Allah’ with one heartbeat and ‘Hu’ with the other. Place your hand on the heart sometimes, feel your heartbeats and try to synchronise the name ‘Allah’. Occasionally, synchronise ‘Allah’ with the pace of the pulse. Imagine the word ‘Allah’ is entering your heart. Dhikr (chanting) of ‘Allah-Hu’ is better and more effective than that of Dhikr-Allah. Those reluctant and afraid of ‘Hu’, instead of deprivation, they might as well synchronise just ‘Allah’ in their heartbeats. People of Dhakuriyah (science of God’s remembrance), and Wird-o-Wadhaif (verbal chanting with the rosary) ought to stay as clean as possible.

      <title>Some selected features of His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi's esoteric personality</title>
      <link>https://gohar-shahi.com/articles/somefetures</link>
      <description>God deployed one of His sub-spirits (Jussa-e-Tawfeeq-e-Ilahi) with His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi at the age of 19, which stayed with His Divine Eminence for a year and under the influence of which, His Divine Eminence tore away His clothes, and went into the jungle of Jam Dataar with a piece of cloth wrapped around his body. The presence of the sub- spirit of God with His Divine Eminence was but temporary yet, and it would be absent for the following 14 years. In the year 1975, the same divine sub-spirit was the reason for His Divine Eminence’s retreat in the jungle of Sehwan.</description>

      <title>Disappearnce of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</title>
      <link>https://gohar-shahi.com/articles/disappearence</link>
      <description>His Holiness Riaz Ahmed revealed in His presence that He would disappear for some time and later reappear in this world alongside Jesus Christ. This return is destined to counter the satanic powers and reconnect humanity with God through the teachings of love and heart awakening.
In anticipation of His disappearance, His Holiness appointed Younus AlGohar as His Divine Eminence's Representative. He declared, Whoever wishes to meet Gohar Shahi (Himself) should meet Younus AlGohar. This appointment was a clear directive to ensure the continuation of His divine mission.
Despite the explicit instructions and foreknowledge provided by His Holiness about His disappearance, certain individuals, including His sons and some family members, falsely declared Him dead. They constructed a tomb in His name and began collecting money from followers, exploiting His Holiness's legacy for personal gain.  
Today, His Holiness's sacred mission is under the guidance and supervision of Younus AlGohar through the establishment of a new organization, Messiah Foundation International. This organization is dedicated to preserving and spreading the true teachings and mission of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed.

      <title>What is Jashan-e-Shahi and the Reasons Why it is Celebrated?</title>
      <link>https://gohar-shahi.com/articles/jashnshahi</link>
      <description>On the 15th of Ramadan 1977, a series of unique secretive conversations (Ilhaamat or inspiration) with God also began. The promise of ‘Radhiya Mardhiya’ (‘Your will is my will, my will is your will’) took place and rank was also granted. Since every rank (martaba) and ascension (meraaj) is related to the 15th of Ramadan, this is why in order to express feelings of happiness and thanksgiving, Jashan-e-Shahi is celebrated every year.</description>
