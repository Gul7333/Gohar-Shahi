Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. The government's address is being held in Papadam city today. This is the inner part of the Baba's court where you can see the poster. Whose glory is on earth? Gaur Shani, Gaur Shani We will live as the mast of the temple. Gaur will be with you. The world will be in chaos. Gaur will be with you. We will stand with you. I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan. In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful. My dear friends, peace be upon you. I have come to your city many times before. The reason for my visit is not political. There is no sectarianism, no discrimination against the government. In every city, every neighbourhood, every house, there are some people with a heart. The aim is to remove those people with a heart and to make their voice heard. There were two types of knowledge in the time of Prophet Mohammad. One was for those who spoke the language, which is called Shariah, and the other was for those who had a heart, which is called Tariqat. In the time of Prophet Mohammad, those who were satisfied with the knowledge of the language, some of them became Khawarij and some became Munafiq. Allah! And those who have attained the knowledge of the heart, they are called the companions of the Messenger of Allah. And they have attained a higher rank than the saints. And in this age, those who have attained the knowledge of the heart, they have been divided into seventy-five sects. And those who have attained the knowledge of the heart, they have become Baba Fareed. Allah! Then what kind of Madrasah did these people go to in the jungles? Those Madrasahs of the heart are in the jungles, and those Madrasahs of the tongue are in the cities. Now, just as this tongue can say, Allah Allah, similarly, that heart can also say, Allah Allah. We have seen the heart of a lamb. It does not have a tongue. How can it say Allah? They say this is the thought of the dervishes. If you are sure that your heart can say Allah, you will not be at peace without it. You say, no, this is a thought. And the dervishes say, your tongue is also a lamb's tongue. How does Allah do this? The meat is hanging between two ribs and the other two ribs are hanging between two palms. This is also meat and that is also meat. When Allah created the body, He put the soul in it. He put six other creatures in it to help the soul, which are called the Lataif. The name of the Prophet is in the Hadith. Some people's work is to think, some people's work is to smell, some people's work is to speak, some people's work is to walk. Those Sat Makhluks have been put in your body. For the help of those Sat Makhluks, nine more have been put in your body. Allah! So the doctor says, the tongue is correct, but why doesn't it speak? There is a difference between humans and animals. If these creatures were in animals, they would also speak. They have necks and tongues. Now, the heart of the cow, there is a creature to feed it. The meat is called the Fawad in Arabic and the creature is called the Qalb. The difference between the heart and the Qalb is the heart. Now, this creature is free and the Qalb is locked up in 180000 cells. Allah hu Akbar! If someone can awaken him and free him, then just like this tongue of Allah does, the same way he can awaken the heart of Allah. Allah hu Akbar! Now, who is that free one? If a person is unaware of the speciality of an egg, he is told that it will fly in the air, it will make noises, he will say that you are wrong. It has no legs, no tongue, no wings, why does he say that it will fly in the air? Its name is Beza. You have Beza Nasuti inside you. There is a rat inside it, and there is an angel inside it. Subhanallah. Allah! Allah Allah Allah Now you have become his teacher. Your tasbih is what you get in the market and its tasbih is inside you. Now you have told him that you have met Allah with this tik tik. Now he has started to meet Allah with the beat of his heart. Sometimes he met Allah, sometimes he didn't. After three years, the heart has become so strong that you can sit and sleep and you will keep saying, Allah, Allah. At that time, Saqeer Sultan Bhai and Rahmatullah say, some people wake up while sleeping, some people sleep and wake up. Some people wake up and worship all night, but they are still in their sleep. And some people are sleeping on their beds, their hearts are saying, Allah, Allah. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Now, a Sikh said, your scholars say that the Quran has divine energy. He said, I was your spy. I taught your children the Quran for 20-25 years. If it had divine energy, why didn't I become enlightened? Wow! It was very cool. The answer to this is also very good. The Quran which has Noor, is the Quran which has Noor in the heart of Prophet Mohammad. This Quran is used to create Noor. Because if you buy a paper from the market, print it, then you will get Noor. There are many hands and machinery attached to it. This is used to create light. When the iron hits the iron, the spark flies. When the verses of the Quran hit the ayat, it creates light. Have you ever tried to create light? There is a practice, take the practice of Surah Mazamal. It repeats Surah Mazamal again and again. It creates light through that repetition. Now the light that is created, it goes out of the tongue, it doesn't go inside. The creatures that have been controlled by that action are their own. Some people try to get the light through Tasbih. They make the sound of Allah with the sound of Tik Tik. Without the sound of Tik Tik, can there be Allah? Then why do they make the sound of Allah with the sound of Tik Tik? Why do they point their fingers? Because Allah and Allah collide with the sound of Tik Tik. When it collides, it becomes light, but that light does not enter the fingers. It stays in the fingers. When your heartbeats start to call Allah, then the light that is inside, when it becomes light, it does not go out, it goes into your blood. When it goes into the blood, it goes from the blood to the veins. When the soul goes to the soul, it starts calling out to Allah. When you go to the grave, you will keep calling out to Allah. Now, there were six creatures that were of the heart, they were neither of light nor of darkness. One creature, which is called the Nafs, was of the devil. When the soul entered the body, the Buddha said, If the soul is purified, the body is purified. The flesh is not purified. The soul is also purified. The body is purified when the soul enters the body. Now, until the Lower Self is not purified, you will not be purified. You are impure. In the 1st Hadith, some people read the Quran and the Quran curses them. Those whose Lower Self is impure, their Lower Self is impure. In the 1st Hadith, the house where the dog is, the angels of mercy do not come to you. This dog said, I didn't say, that dog said. Why did he say that dog? He was made in heaven to protect Adam, and he is still protecting Adam. What is his fault? If you tie him to the corner of the alley, what will he do to protect you? He said to this dog, the people who have these dogs inside, the angels of mercy don't come there. Gohar Shahi, Mehra Shahi, Gohar Shahi, Gohar Shahi, Jisne Habdi Naam Dikhai, Gohar Shahi, Gohar Shahi, Jisne Hamne Lehmat Pai, Gohar Shahi, Gohar Shahi. Majid Asif Sahib says, A Muqtadi should first remember Allah. Purify your Lower Self. The Qur'an is not for those who have a dog-like Lower Self. Quran says that when the Lower Self is purified, then you should read the Quran. One moment of contemplation is better than a hundred years of worship. At that time, the Quran will enter your heart. Now you think of the Quran as a book, right? At that time, the Quran will enter your heart. Then you will reflect on each and every verse. The Quran itself says, The pure ones have been taught this. Those whose bodies have become pure, they have been taught this. They have also been taught this and brought people to this teaching. Those whose souls were pure, they have made the disbelievers Muslims. And those whose souls were not pure, those who did not have the Quran in them, when they started preaching from the Quran, they started preaching from the Quran. And those whose souls were not pure, When they started preaching the Quran, they made a sect. They made the disbelievers Muslims. The believers and the Ammarites called the Muslims disbelievers. Some said they are hypocrites, disbelievers, polytheists, Jews. Now how will we purify the Lower Self? Yes, no doubt. To purify him, the beings like Baba Farid, the beings like Allah, the beings like Ajmer, went to the jungles to purify that ego. Yes, no doubt. Now how can the lion purify him? Right. They have purified him in the jungles, now how can the lion purify him? The lion is afraid of going to the jungles. Yes, it is a big problem. There are snakes, scorpions and lions. They are afraid. Then how can they purify their nafs? When Allah will echo in your nafs, when Allah will echo in your nafs, when your nafs will surround Allah from all sides. When Allah will surround him from all sides, he will have no way out. Some souls do not take the divine pleasure, they die. Let them die. Some of the souls do not die, they take the divine pleasure to live. They take the divine pleasure to live. But when we take the divine pleasure, there is a condition for it. The inner creatures make a condition that you recite the Kalima. Then they start reciting the Kalima out of helplessness. The Kalima had the effect of turning a black dog into a white dog. The Kalima had the effect of turning it into a bull. The Kalima had the effect of turning it into you. Then you started to offer Salat, he also started to offer Salat, you started to do Zikr, he also started to do Zikr. Then you took him to the gathering of Huzoor. At that time Huzoor and the audience were very angry. They were angry with him and his Master. I have purified the dog, made it a human and I have taken my own life. This is the status of the Prophet. Your reach has reached the Holy Prophet. Now, Allah is left. The Holy Prophet is in this world. The Holy Spirit is above, but it is in this world. Allah is the end of the world, but still, He is the name and the sign. Now, the way to reach Allah. When you have the four hours of Allah, the light of Allah will enter your heart. In the holy Quran, the poison is the reflection of the inner self. The system here is of electricity, and there is the system of light. Here, the mobile phones are here. The waves of electricity rise from here and reach America. If the waves of electricity rise from here and reach America, if someone has light, where will those waves go? The new waves will rise from here and reach the Arsh-e-Mawla. Now, your connection has only been established through the divine telephone from the Arsh-e-Mawla. Now, you have to talk to those people. You have only established a connection. When Prophet Mohammad went to the Shab-e-Meraj, Allah gave you Salat as a gift. I have given it to you. I have not given it to you. You were a Prophet even before you came into this world. You were a Prophet even before you came into this world. I have given it to this Ummah so that they can give these gifts to their Ummah. So that they can send me. They will send me and send me for 5 times. Then I will remember them and they will remember me. Allah! Now, his voice is heard in the Arsh-e-Mawla, and he is called a Momin. That prayer is the Meeraaj of a Momin. In Surah Ajraaq, Airaam says, We have come with faith. Allah has said, no, tell them to only bring Islam. You will become a believer when you have light in your heart. When you have light in your heart, you will become a Muslim. At this time, you have different sects. Sunnis, Shias, Wahabis, all say that we are right. So why would the sect be right? The sect can never be right. It is already created. The one who created it is right. Believe me, neither Sunni nor Shia nor Wahhabi is right. If they are right, then the Ummati is right. And what is the Ummati? The one who has the light of Allah is the Ummati. When that light is gone, you become a Sunni, Shia, Wahhabi. When that light comes back, you will never say, I am Sunni, Shia, Wahhabi. You will say, I am just your follower. Now, when the light comes in your heart, like the way magnets are found in the desert, like the way books are made here, the city you take to, its direction will be there. If you have the light in your heart, then whichever sect you belong to, your path will be towards Allah. No doubt, sir. The center is the same, you will not go down. No matter which sect you belong to. Now, the question is, Now, first find out what is the religion of Allah. Allah is the greatest. I don't understand his religion. Yes, I don't understand. There are other religions in Torah, Zaboor, Gospels and Quran. What is their religion? Their religion is love. Their religion is love. And when someone falls in love with them, they become their own. Now you listen to the speeches, until the love and devotion from the Holy Prophet is complete, you don't get the medicine, right? If you get the medicine, you will get the love and devotion. I have not taken any medicine. We will tell you how to take medicine and how to love. Gohar Shahi! Gohar Shahi! Gohar Shahi! Gohar Shahi! Gohar Shahi! Gohar Shahi! Whenever Allah will knock in your heart, anything that enters your heart, you fall in love with it. When Allah is in your heart, you will fall in love with Allah. When you fall in love with Allah, you say, I have a lot of love for Allah and his Beloved. You say, you are a liar. Love is not about the tongue, love is about the heart. You don't fall in love, you fall in love. If you say it in a language, it is called love. If you say it in a language, it is called love. If you say Allah, Allah, Allah, you will fall in love with Allah. Allah does not take anyone's favours. This is a quality of Allah. If you spend one rupee for Allah, Allah will return you ten rupees. Why should we return the favour we have done? If you do a good deed, God will give you ten times more. If you love someone a little, God will give you ten times more. And the one you love, you look at him. You don't look at him with a straight face, but with love. The day God looks at you, that is the stage of love. So I am yours and you are mine. Now Allah has seen you, right? And the second point is that you see Allah. Is that the second secret? What is that secret? Allah has put everything in this body from the seven heavens. If he is interested in exploring the realm of Malakut, he will be able to enhance his heart and strengthen it. Through this, he will be able to explore the realm of Malakut. If he is interested in going into the realm of Jabrut, he will be able to strengthen his soul. If he is interested in going into the realm of Lahut, he will be able to prepare the subtlety of Sirri. If he thought that he should go and see Allah, he would have prepared the Subtlety of Allah. He has put the true creatures inside you. Now those creatures, their upbringing is not just meat and bread, their upbringing is through the light of Allah. Now those who are being brought up by Allah, their upbringing is through the light of Allah. When she was being raised, she became an adult. They say that a saint walked for 12 years, why didn't he walk for 13 years? Why didn't he walk for 11 years? Just like a child becomes an adult at the age of 15, becomes capable of a job, similarly, at the age of 12, these creatures become capable of following the footsteps of the Holy Prophet. At that time, you thought, see what the Holy Prophet is doing. You didn't think, she came out of this chest and entered the feet of Prophet Muhammad. At that time, Bulleh Shah said, If you take the Loki Panch, you will fall in love. If you take the Loki Masjid, you will fall in love. Those who remember the five Raab, even the Namaz is a remembrance of the Lord, their end will be the Masjid-e-Bajamat. What else will they do? And those who say Allah Allah with it, they will definitely reach the feet of Allah. Now you think what is happening up there? That creature of yours, the one who has the name of Allah in his mind, it has gone up. The angels stopped it. No, they didn't. He said, whatever is there will burn before the House of Allah, angels cannot go beyond it, they burn. And he reached the place where the Lord's Essence is. From the physical body, Prophet Mohammad reached there and from these creatures, the saints reach there. Now our scholars say that if the saints could see, it would be only through dreams. Yes, I do. Allah grants them the child of light. Their sight is then in their senses and voice. We will be with you. We will be with you. We will be with you. Subhan Allah. Now, this world is a copy. People are seeing the pictures from here. And this is your city. First you reached there, in Malkoot. In the Qur'an, Talamah Iqbal said, No, there is more life beyond the stars. There is more life beyond that. And when he went beyond that, he said, There is more value of love. He reached nearer to love. There is love. There is love, there is lover, there is lover. Wow! Then his image comes down to his heart. His eyes come down to his heart. Then Allah says, now you go down, now whoever sees you, they will see me. For that, he is called the perfect Spiritual Guide. For that, the true Sultan, Buhur Ahmedullah said, The one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has been granted the name of Allah, the one who has When he is sleeping, he is connected to the heavens. This is the glory of this man. Now, if we meet a Spiritual Guide, we should meet one who can reach God. Now, there are many people who are disciples of the Spiritual Guides here. They became disciples of the Spiritual Guide only when they considered him perfect. But what is the news? Whose Spiritual Guide is perfect? There are one Gaus and three books in the whole world. These are the miracles of doing Bai'at. There are 40 Abadans, they too are not allowed to do Bai'at. When there are four people in the world, how many will be in this city? So in whichever city, how many lakhs will be made? Now, without a Spiritual Guide, you cannot even find God. Who is the identity of a Spiritual Guide? It is necessary that you have a perfect identity. Put a thief from Lahore in that corner, a thief from Peshawar in that corner. They don't know each other, but their eyes will meet. They will understand that my stomach is a wheel. I want a marriage. I want a marriage. I want a marriage. I want the truth of the Prophet. I want a marriage. I want a marriage. I want a marriage that shows the way of God. I want a marriage. I want a marriage. One person is sitting there. One person is sitting there. When their hearts collide, when your heart is filled with divine energy, you go to Baba Gursa, there and here, and your hearts will collide and you will be enlightened. Then you go to the Data Sahib for the satisfaction of your heart. There you will find Allah and here you will find Allah. When your hearts collide, you will have a connection there as well. Then you go to your Spiritual Guide. Whatever happened to Baba Farid and Data Sahib, if you go to your Spiritual Guide and you have the same experience, then your Spiritual Guide will work. Then even if your life is lost, you should not let it go. Then you will be the support of Allah, no matter what. If you go to Him again and again, nothing happens, then He is nothing. Only a saint has the right to take the oath of allegiance. Even the children of a saint do not have the right to take the oath of allegiance. If he was a descendant, then he would have inherited the prophethood. If the son of a prophet could not be a prophet, then how could the son of a saint be a saint? If a person is not a prophet, and he claims to be a prophet, you call him a disbeliever. And is he really a disbeliever? You call a believer a disbeliever. If there is no saint, then he claims to be a saint. Then what will he be? He comes close to disbelief. and the time and fortune of the one who believes in him is also left. And it is necessary for a saint. What do we have? Sajjada Naseen, Gaddi Naseen, they have been coming for years, doing Bai'at. They are empty, right? There must be a saint who has come in a day, right? Not all of them, right? Our scholars have seen that they are empty, they don't even have the knowledge. If they are doing Bai'at, why should we stay behind? So they started doing the Bai'at. Then our Mufti said, if our Shadid does Bai'at, why shouldn't we do it? Then our Mufti also started doing Bai'at. Then our Taweez writers said, we should also do Bai'at. This system got ruined in this way. Now, who considers himself as a saint, for him, it is necessary to have a saint who is Allah. A saint is a friend of Allah. A friend should be able to see his friend. Or talk to him. Neither can he talk to him, not even on the phone. He can't even see him and say, he is my friend. It is a trick. A saint has a condition. or in seeing You should see him and talk to him then your Bai'at will be lessened 99 names of Allah All of them know 98 names of attributes 1,24,000 prophets mention the attributes of Islam Even if they meet, they can't reach the one who is in the attributes Meaning, even if 1,24,000 prophets meet, they can't reach the one who is in the attributes Yes, it is a tradition. Oh The Prophet said that Moses was in the world of Kothur and he went to the Prophet and smiled. The Prophet's body had the attributes of the Lord of the worlds and he was not able to bring the warmth of the Lord. The Prophet's body had the attributes of the Lord and he smiled. Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah But the Prophet was in pain because he did not get the personal name of the one who saw him. The Prophet was unconscious and the saints saw him. One day Jesus was also there. O Allah, I am very fond of seeing you. Allah said, have you seen the state of Moses? Because Jesus Christ used to mention about the saints, that was also a quality. Then how will you see him? You will see my beloved or his Ummah. Then Jesus Christ said, O Allah, take care of the prophet. I have a But what about the prayers that don't take place? Yes, that's true. We will ask about the prayers that take place. We will ask about the prayers that you used to offer in your mosque. Why did you leave so much? We will ask about those prayers. There is a condition for prayer. The one who is in the tongue, is in the heart. You are a seeker. If you have more in your tongue and heart, you are a hypocrite to the worldly people, right? If you have more in your tongue and heart for the world, you are a hypocrite, right? If you have more in your tongue and heart for Allah, you are a big hypocrite. Allah said to Prophet Muhammad, Qul huwalla wa khadr, kaidi ye Allah eke, aapne ameen ka? Aapne logon kaha, kaidu ye Allah eke, jino ne ameen ka musluman? Jino ne mina kaafir, jino ne iloo ajad kareem munafir. Aap musluman kisko kaida? Gari gari kaida, rooz kaida, kaidi ye Allah eke. Abulli shah warmaat, hiki gulkte waj galum muktum. Allah is the greatest Allah is the greatest You know who you are saying Allah to You know who you are saying Allah to You are saying Allah to your heart You are saying Allah to your heart He says there is no flour in the house He says there is no flour in the house Allah is the greatest Allah is the greatest He says wife is sick Allah is the greatest Allah is the greatest He says you are late for work The heart of a hypocrite does not accept the truth. The heart of a hypocrite does not accept the truth. And the body of a hypocrite does not act. Tell me, your heart was a hypocrite, wasn't it? Your heart was a hypocrite, wasn't it? And this is called the form of prayer. The Majlis says that the form of prayer of every person is the form of prayer. The speciality of God is the form of prayer. It is the reality of prayer. It is the reality of prayer. It is the reality of prayer. So, you must search for the truth. This Namaz Surah is recited by 72 sects. It is not a big deal to offer 5 times of Namaz Surah. The Quran says that this Namaz Surah is a destruction and a show. How is it a show? People are saying that it is recited with great zeal and pride. People are saying that it is recited with great zeal and pride. Allah says, no. I don't look at his face, beard or prostration. I look at his heart and intentions. The one who is seen by the world, he is smart. The one who is seen by Allah, he is business. So he should pray alone at home. This is a demonstration. How is it destroyed? It is a five-time prayer. The heart is filled with arrogance. People say that he also performs Tahajjud. He is even more arrogant. People praise him. He is even more arrogant. One day he saw a non-prayerful person. He looked at him with a lot of arrogance. He said, I am better than you. He did not know that he also performs Tahajjud. He is even more arrogant. Then he says, I am better than everyone, I am the one who performs Tahajjud, I am the one who offers Salat. But he says that Huzoor is greater than everyone. He accepts all the Sunnahs. He accepts all the Sunnahs. Then he says, what is the difference between me and Huzoor? And for whom did I create the whole world? For whom did I create you? And you say, he is like me. When he reached here, his faith was lost. This is the form of Salat that will destroy your faith. This is the gift of God. Whoever God wants. Not the one who wants to be, but whoever God wants. For that, you must first learn to say Allah, Allah. This is your first lesson. The first lesson is the Kalima Tayyab. Kalma Tayyab is mentioned in the Hadith. The original Kalma Tayyab is mentioned in the Quran. The Quran says, I sit and stand, and you take my Zikr. Once you recite the Kalma, you become a Muslim. Why do you recite it again and again? Why are you Muslims now? Once you recite it, you become a Muslim. You become a believer. How can you make butter without milk? And butter is made from ragda, right? And the ragda of the Kalima is used to make butter. This is the first word of your Quran. Allam, you say the letters of Makkah, but you don't pay attention to what Allam-ul-Amin is. And the one who is standing in front of you, ask him what he is. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. SubhanAllah. I kept on saying it and people kept on writing it down. Thousands of books were attributed to me. If you are afraid of its darkness, then say La ilaha illa Allah. This is also mentioned. If you are not able to say it, then say Muhammad Rasool Allah with a meme. This is a guidance from the Divine Light. Otherwise, go to the book. I don't know if this book will misguide you or lead you on the right path. For this, first of all, you will have to put your heartbeats in the name of Allah. Then you will try to keep working and Allah will keep on being Allah. This is called, Dastkar Mein Dil Allah. Then you will try to read a newspaper or drive a car and Allah will keep on being Allah. It will be successful. Then you will try to keep on praying and keep on saying Allah Allah. At that time your tongue will say, Say Allah is one. Your heart will say, Allah is Allah. And Allah is the hearer. Your heart will say, Allah Allah. Now the tongue is in the heart. The tongue is declaring and the heart is confirming. This is called, Arabic You say, the Americans listen. And the heart is in the head. What is this that the people of the House of Allah hear? This is the prayer that will take your Salat to the House of Allah. This prayer is the prayer of a Momin. It is the prayer of a Momin, not a Wali. The prayer of a Wali is something else. His voice has gone, but not his own. When the souls of the creatures in you will be strengthened, So when it is time for their prayer, their food is more worthy. Your food is more worthy. The food of this body is more worthy. Their food is more worthy. Their food is more worthy. This food is more worthy. This food is more worthy. Because you are more worthy, you have this food. You have got the copy of this food. Allah has shown the true way of Islam. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have shown you the truth. I have been to many places and I have been to many places and I have been to many places and I have been to many places and I have been to many places and I have been to many places and I have been to many places and I have been to many places and I have been to many places and I have been to many places and I have been to many places and I have been to many places Allah! You sleep, may Allah do that. And your wife and children, she doesn't have a wife and children. And you sleep, she doesn't sleep. Now, the second point is that this body is not related to the eternal or the eternal. There was no body before this, before this world and there will be no body after this world. There, other bodies will be given, which will neither burn nor die. This is the thing. They will neither burn nor die. Those bodies will be given. These bodies will remain as dust in this soil. When this body does not want to go ahead, does not want to go into hell, then why is it offered Salat? Why is it offered? It has no connection with the outside. The soul that is related to the future, that soul is dependent on it. That soul is dependent on this body. Just like a mother lifts her son, this body makes him prostrate. When the son becomes young, the mother becomes dependent on him. Allah! Even if the body is sleeping, even if it is dead, it does not care. It will offer its prayers in the house of the Lord. It will be free. It will offer its prayers in the house of the Lord. And it will not raise its head until Allah answers, Labbaik Ya Abdeen! Now, some people object to this. We, the scholars of the Quran, do not do this. I will give you an example. Once upon a time, there was a man who was praying for a long time. When he was praying for a long time, he became old and he prayed, saying, O Allah, please save me from praying. I have become very old. Allah accepted his prayer and in the morning, he lost his consciousness. Yes, I do. It means that there is no forgiveness for Salat until the soul and the voice are finished. That old man had taken out his soul. If he had taken out his soul, he would have been sleeping and his soul would have been with Allah. People said to Ghost Pak, you praise Sheikh Baka a lot, but he doesn't pray. Talaus Pak said, you don't know, they are always present in the Kaaba. They become Muarif. There is an Aarif and a Muarif. What is Aarif? Can you explain it? Because people are going to listen to Darbar. They say this is Aarif and this is Muarif. I don't know what is this? When a person gets rid of this body, goes to the jungle, gets hungry, thirsty, prays, fasts, and weeps in remembrance of Allah, whenever Allah wills, He puts His manifestation on him. He puts His body on him and his body becomes a saint. When his body becomes a saint, he can go to the gathering of Huzoor-e-Paak along with his body. The second type is of the Mua'rif. They put more effort into their inner self. They awaken their inner self. They make the soul stand out. Then when the manifestation happens, the soul manifests on top of another soul. The soul becomes a saint. The body becomes a saint. The body becomes a saint. The body becomes a saint. The body becomes a saint. The body becomes a saint. The body becomes a saint. The body becomes a saint. His body and soul are sacrificed. He is seen from a distance. He is seen from a distance. How fortunate he is to be sitting in the gathering of Huzoor with his body and soul. In the meantime, Huzoor speaks to someone. He asks, who should I speak to? I cannot see. He says, I am speaking to the person whose body is in the creation and his soul is with me. And that Ash'had says, The Prophet says, how fortunate I am to be present here and there. At this point, it is time for prayer. It is commanded that the people of the Zahir-e-Walayat should go and offer their prayers in Zahir, otherwise, the Walayat will be taken away. And the people of the Ruh-e-Walayat offer their prayers behind the Prophet. Even if they are sleeping at home, they spiritually offer their prayers behind the Prophet. This is called Mu'arif. When that Aarif passes away, he is granted Walaeed on his body. When the body is finished, Walaeed is finished. His Faiz is finished. And if any soul of that soul is granted Walaeed, it becomes a Wali in the grave and sits there. And what does it mean that people keep on receiving Faiz? That is Aarif and this is Muarif. And there is another proof. Once, Majid ul-Islam went to the mosque. He saw a man sleeping. Yes, Sardar. He did ablution, and immediately started reciting the Sunnah of the time, the time of Fajr. Everyone saw that it was the time of Fajr. Then he prayed the Zuhr prayer, and it was the time of Zuhr. Then he prayed Asr prayer, and a narrator writes that the sun has returned. At that time he said, Majid-ul-Saab, you were the master of the eyes. It was better that you had seen my condition before you woke me up. I was with the one whom you were praying for. We stop our talks here. We reject this. They say, if this was the case, why did Huzoor offer prayers in Zahiri? What was the need for Huzoor to offer prayers? You were a prophet even before the prayers. You say, I was a prophet even before the advent of Adam. Huzoor made religion. If they didn't offer Salat on Tuesday because of some fatigue, then the whole Ummah would be tired. They would make it a Sunnah. They would make it a Sunnah. Huzoor, the people of Pakistan offered Salat in the state of severe illness. Why did you have to offer Salat? They knew that people who say, In the future, people will come who say that they were like us. You also prayed in a state of illness and they will say that they have a fever and they are also sick and they also don't pray. This is why Huzoor, if you pray, pray for the Ummah. They don't need to pray. If anyone follows one of the Sunnah, then he will be forgiven for all his sins. One Sunnah is like this. If you follow one Sunnah, then you will be forgiven for all your sins. You will be forgiven for all your sins. Which Sunnah is that? The seeing of God. What if he follows only one Sunnah? Allah o Allah. In fact, it is such that Allah puts a manifestation on them. Some people become paralyzed. Some people cannot bear it and become paralyzed. Some people can bear it and become paralyzed. Allah o Allah. Now, there is a condition. Once a person comes under the manifestation of Allah, Allah will look at him 360 times a day. Once he sees him, he will commit a grave sin. If he dies, his grave will be the place where his faiz will be established and the sins of those who sit in his grave will begin to burn. In the Hadith, the heart and the defeat is due to the mercy of Allah. The one who is defeated by the manifestation of Allah. If someone is deceived, he will beat people, he will abuse them and they will start benefiting. In the Dhanka Sharif, the one who is beaten gets benefited. The third one is that he would go to the king and beat him up. The last time he went, he didn't beat him up. He thought that he was the king and left. And the third one is that his words would start the faiz. Now when he sees 360 times, people's eyes would start burning. When the Companions started to see Kaaf, there was no one there. There was only a dog. That dog became Hazrat Qutmeer. That dog didn't pray. He was sitting in his company. He kept reciting the Nazir-e-Rehmat. So he became Hazrat Qutmeer. That dog became pure. When your dog becomes pure with light, then the Nazir-e-Rehmat is also light. That dog will go to the desert in the form of William Bower. No doubt, no doubt. The mercy of God's eyes always fell on Prophet Mohammad. This is the reason why those who sit in the company of Prophet Mohammad have attained a higher rank than the saints. And the second proof is when Prophet Mohammad went to the Chhabe Mirar, he saw that Moses was offering Salat in the grave. He was not offering it physically. If a creature was offering prayers, it would be present above the creature. Then who will get the reward of that creature? Moses A.S. Now I will tell you the method of offering prayers. How this medicine goes inside the body. And what is the path? The British say, Namaz Roza Kam Sutho O Rasta Koi Dujo Baba Farid Ahmedullah ne bhi kaha tha ki jis rasta pe main chala agar tum us rasta pe chalo to janti janti ho wo is rasta ke kaha tha dil wale ke rasta ka to lor darwaza se nikalna shirbo ka Dil ka rasta jo bhi dil ka rasta pe jaye janti janti hai Wow! He said, if the door of your heart opens, then there is a guarantee. It doesn't open until Allah's will. If Allah's will is there, then there is a guarantee. We will be with you. The world will be with you. The way is to have the right to the rightful rights. It doesn't matter who you are. Whether you are a woman, a Wahhabi or anyone else. When Allah comes inside you, you will be Allah's. And when Allah comes inside the disbelievers, they will also be Allah's. This is the final word of the Kalima. Write Allah on a white paper every day for 6 seconds. Wow! Yes. This is the real meaning of Mismarism. SubhanAllah! Mismarism brings the light of the sun or the light of the lamp into the eyes. Then they put their eyes on the glass and it cracks. But the 180,000 webs cannot break the light of the sun. When Allah's name enters the eyes, it is as if He breaks the walls and sits on the heart. When He sits on the heart, the heartbeat will be faster. So it is His Tasmih and Allah is with Him. Allah 21 Then he will be in the sun. Then one day he will be shining like the sun. When he shines like the sun, then he will be fearless. He will go to the grave with great enthusiasm. Now the rejecters will come and ask, first of all, tell me who is your Lord? The first question will be, keep quiet, and trouble them. Don't be afraid of them. You are going to be punished. You are going to be punished. And then they will ask, Who is your God? Silence! And then they will ask, Are you dumb? Tell us who is your God? Show us your face. He is shining. O Allah! I am a lover Who showed the way of God. I am the mother of lovers. They don't have the courage to ask you any other question. They will say, O man of God, sleep peacefully. Peace be upon you. You know, your Lord knows. Because they know that this name of God is with the Ghost Park in this time. This is a disciple of the Ghost Park. The Ghost Park has taken a promise from Allah 70 times that my disciple will not live without faith. Wow! You said, who will be my patient? My patient will be the one who is Zakir. Wow! Then you said, I believe in Zakir only the one whose heart is Allah's. Wow! The one whose heart is Allah's, I believe in Zakir. If there is a physical copy of Baha'u'llah, who has the benefit of Ghous Pak, who is a patient of Ghous Pak, Allah becomes a copy of their patients, then they are called a copy. Wow! He said, I have no doubt that he is Ghost Park. Why are you afraid of the one who is the Prophet? He has seen the state of the people. When Ghost Park went to the grave, he hid his face. I am his follower, tell me who is your God? I asked Ghost Park. He grabbed one of his hands and the other grabbed the other's hand. I will answer this later, but first you answer my question. He got angry and said, what is this man doing? He pulled his hand and he couldn't shake it. Such a great power! Such a great power! Even a human being does not have such a great power. He said, tell me, what is your question? When Allah had created Adam, why did you say that he would bring about disorder in the world? You didn't know that such a man would come into this world? They were angry. They were angry. They said, Ram was a big man. Everyone said, I said, leave me alone. I asked him. I asked everyone. He said, no, you will not come back. I said, leave one. He asked. I said, ok, I left him. I asked the angels, what should I answer? What can we say? There is no answer to this. If there is no answer, then he will not leave the man. Our man is trapped. So we turned to Allah. Allah, now you tell us, who should we leave the man to? Allah said, now make a promise to him. Make him agree to something. Then Ghost Park said, SubhanAllah My patient will go to heaven without this book. He was afraid of that. Ghost Park grabbed him by the hand that his patient would not be able to hold him. He started sleeping at night. SubhanAllah He used to think of his finger as a pen. He used to imagine Allah writing on his heart and sleep. He would fall asleep on this. In this world, special angels come at midnight. Quran If you are awake, you should fast, perhaps you have got an eye in your memory. And it is possible that Allah will include you in worship all night. Because the intention while sleeping is the same in dreams. You will sleep while reciting Allah, I will also recite Allah. We have a canteen in Chakwal, some conductors come to the canteen and sleep. Yes, sir. If he was eating, he would hear the voices of Lahore, Pindi, Lahore, Pindi. He would wake up and see that he is eating, but he would hear the voices of Lahore, Pindi. Because Lahore was thinking towards Pindi, Pindi was thinking towards Lahore. When your thoughts are towards Allah, then Allah will keep coming to you. No doubt, sir. So, Until you meet the beat of your heart, that is called Zikr-e-Khafi. Zikr-e-Khafi is worship, not a destination. When the beat of your heart calls out, Allah! Allah! This is your first step in Tariqat. Did you hear the words Shariah, Tariqat and Haqiqat? Shariah is related to this tongue and Tariqat is related to this heart. And when Allah reaches to Allah, that is the reality. The reality is in these eyes. And when Allah grants something to him, that is the realisation. There is a Mufti Sahib in Larkana. He says, we say that the method, the reality, the forgiveness, everything is in the Shariah. We put people in the Shariah, then he tells them the other lesson. He says, these are special things, not common things. This is also true. But we have experienced that the special things have become common. Now you get special things in general. If we are not looking for that special thing, what is the need to say? If we go to Norway, there is a board in the sea, it is written there that there is no world beyond it. If someone who is looking for the world reaches there, then he will settle there. What should I do further? There is no world. When you say that everything is in Shariah, then if someone is seeking Allah, then he will settle there. If I tell him that there is a way, there is a reality, there is a knowledge, then he will follow the path. If he is a student, he will follow the path. Students are like that. So when he follows the path, it is fine. If he does not find the way, he does not find the reality, he follows the path, then whoever is killed in the path of Allah, he becomes a martyr. He is not found in his search. Wherever he is killed, he becomes a martyr. Now, this is allowed. Many people fear Allah. Why do they fear Him? Because He is Jalal-e-Izzat. Allah has made man to reject Him, even if He wants to bring him down to the mountains. The heart of man has accepted Him. This is the true Jalal-e-Izzat. Fire is Jalal-e-Izzat. Everyone is afraid of it. Without it, there is no livelihood. Every house burns. It is the law of nature. Nothing is cooked without heat. Even crops are not cooked without heat. When they are about to burn, Allah the Almighty showers rain. Even your pot is not cooked without heat. When the spices are about to burn, you sprinkle water on it. Even the chest is not cooked without heat. Allah! Allah! When a person tries to instil Allah in their heart, Satan thinks that if Allah enters their heart, they will be gone for a lifetime. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, went to the jungle in his youth. When he was performing his wudu and praying, he would look far away. When he would try to instil Allah in their heart, Satan would come close to them and trouble them. One day he got very angry and said, Allah does not let me go inside, so he ran after him with a stick. I will kill him today. He was very clever, he kept running slowly so that I could chase him. The more he ran, the more he ran. Then the voice said, O Aba Yazid, he does not die with a stick, he dies with the light of Allah. To it runs the Kirkari to the Kirkari noor Allah noor hoja But a body was time here. I'm a tallah noor Allah noor. Okay, the share was Tom say jadu ghani chalega I'm a mara. I'm a sir. Thank you I'm a scope at a key heritage on Ismael's are say that Poshka There are some people who do Allah, Allah, Allah, and Allah is inscribed on their hearts. The Quran says, Some people have faith inscribed on their hearts. This is their faith. They are Allah's followers. There are some people who do Allah, Allah, Allah, and Allah is inscribed on their hearts. They are not God nor are they separate. SubhanAllah! Don't be afraid, we are not prostrating to you. We are prostrating to the one who has the Kaaba in you. Allah! When the Kaaba came to Rabia Basri's heart, she was also commanded to go and offer the Kaaba. And I have made you from the clay of the Kaaba, and I have made him from my light. Allah! At that time Maulana Rumi said, For a heart whose food is the Kaaba, a heart is better than a thousand Kaabas. Ibrahim A.S. is the basis of this and this is the light of Allah's light. Now, when he came to the Kaaba, people asked Sultan Sahib, Why don't you go to the King? He said, the Kaaba is right here. The Kaaba is right here. Let's make a little argument. They say, why did Prophet Mohammad go to the Kaaba? Prophet Mohammad was the Kaaba of the Kaaba. If he could go to the King, he could not go to Prophet Mohammad. If Huzoor would not have gone to Kaaba, then no one would have gone. Then what would they say to us? When they are like us, they say, how can we believe in people like us? If Huzoor would have gone to Kaaba, then he would have gone for us. Otherwise, they say, people like Rabia Basri, they go to Kaaba, who are the leaders of our Kaaba. I am the King! I am the King! I am the King! I am the King! Why did Shah Mansoor climb the wall? He said, why do you go to that Kaaba? He said, the Kaaba of Kapilendra, the Noori Kaaba, it is with you. Yes, it is with me. It is the Kaaba of Chochu, right? You go to the Kaaba, come to me. Then the fatwa was issued that he refuses to go to the Kaaba. This is the reason why the Fatwa was issued. Yes, it is the truth. Now, there are those who have the Kaaba as their home. Then there is one who has the map of Allah. Yes, the one who has the map of Allah. The one who has the map of Allah. For him, Allah says, I become his tongue. The one he speaks to, I become his hand. The one he holds. At that time, the true Sultan Abu Rahmatullah says, If you call him Allah, then he is not without a soul. If you call him Allah, then he is not without a soul. Now the devil has the Hindu army of the Jinn. He commands you to destroy it, destroy it, I don't know to what extent it will reach. You don't have a Jinn to fight it. That satanic force will strike you to stop us. From where this Zikr is given, Allah gives them a Rahmani force. That satanic force will strike you and the Rahmani force will strike the satans. And the army of Allah will support you until the Lord of the worlds awakens within you. Then you will not be a slave, but a slave. You will not be poor, but a poor slave. For this, we neither take the oath of allegiance nor do we ask for anything from you. There is a faiz. There is a faiz. When I imagine that I am writing Allah on my heart, then first of all, it is the right of your Spiritual Guide. It is said that in difficult times, call upon your Spiritual Guide. Right now, you are taking permission for Allah. What is a more difficult task than this? Allah! If you want to take the fast of Huzoor, then take the fast of Huzoor. If you are getting the blessings of the fast of Huzoor, if you never remember the fast, then take the Kaaba. Then you will get the blessings of Huzoor. At that time, whoever comes in front of you, he is your Spiritual Guide. To attain the personality is not the goal. The goal is to attain Allah. You can attain it from anywhere. Yes, there are cars parked here. Yes, sir. You can get in any car. These are the cars of the Naxalites, Chishtis, Qadris and Sarwardis. Whoever's engine is not working, you can sit in it. Allah is great! Allah is great! Allah is great! Allah is great! Allah is great! Allah is great! If you can't sit in one, you can sit in the other. It's not a crime. If you sit on the engine of the car, you will not be charged. No doubt. But if you sit on the car and it is running, then if you want to get off, you will be injured. Yes. Then you will not be able to get off. If you have the blessing of the heart, then you are blessed. Yes. Then you don't need to go anywhere. If you don't have the blessing of the heart, then you can go anywhere. Allah is the Greatest. I am the King. I am the King. Allah is the Greatest. Whether you take the Bai'at or not, we will support you until you become the light of the world. Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest. For this, if Allah starts with your heart, then pray for it. If Allah does not start, I If you think that this is a karma, then the same things are with the non-believers. What is given to the non-believers is given to you, so what is this karma on you? If you want to see that Allah's karma is on you, then go deep into his remembrance. Within 4-5-6 days, Allah's karma has started from within and it has become his karma. You must remember me, I will remember you. You must remember the one who you are friends with. If you don't remember Allah even after trying, then you have no Karam. It is possible that he has given you wealth and removed you from yourself. Then when Allah started, then he gave you a car, then that is Karam. Then he gave you a job, then that is Karam. The secret of testing yourself and your Spiritual Guide is how much Allah is kind to me. This is my only bad luck. In Gujranwala, an Englishman said, I will become a Muslim. I will quit drinking. I will pray, I will fast, but your scholars could not explain one thing to me. What is that? They said, we do not give you a guarantee that you will go to the mosque and do the baisal. Do everything. Do everything. Tell him to do everything and then give us the guarantee. Tell him that we don't have our own guarantee. Wow, what a great speech. My Shahi, my Shahi. Gohar Shahi, Gohar Shahi. The Prophet's son. Gohar Shahi, Gohar Shahi. He started saying, so this religion is weak, which has no guarantee. So your religion is weak, which you don't give guarantee. We left everything, but you still say there is no guarantee. Wow So for whom? If you want to take Zikr, then do it. Test your luck. There will be many people who have come as a part of the group. There will be many people who have come to see, to hear. There will be many people of the heart who have a desire for the heart. Now, whoever has a desire for the heart, it is necessary for him that he also accepts, and I also accept. The one who needs to be mentioned is me. I will see him. Ghor Shahi! Ghor Shahi! Ghor Shahi! Ghor Shahi! Ghor Shahi! Ghor Shahi! Ghor Shahi! Ghor Shahi! Ghor Shahi! Ghor Shahi! Now I will read Allah from my tongue. Those who want to take the Zikr of the heart, they can read Allah with me. but it is a cookie Hooray! Hooray! Go Jai! Go Jai!</p></body></html>
