        Some selected features of His
Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahiâ€™s
esoteric personality
    </h1>
    <p>
        God deployed one of His sub-spirits (Jussa-e-Tawfeeq-e-Ilahi) with His
Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi at the age of 19, which stayed with His
Divine Eminence for a year and under the influence of which, His Divine
Eminence tore away His clothes, and went into the jungle of Jam Dataar
with a piece of cloth wrapped around his body. The presence of the sub-
spirit of God with His Divine Eminence was but temporary yet, and it
would be absent for the following 14 years. In the year 1975, the same
divine sub-spirit was the reason for His Divine Eminenceâ€™s retreat in the
jungle of Sehwan.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the age of 25, Jussa-e-Gohar Shahi (the sub-spirit of Gohar Shahi) was
coronated as the Commander of the Esoteric Cavalry. Thanks to this, His
Divine Eminence has been protected against the mischief of terrestrial
Satans and the forces of evil. Jussa-e-Tawfeeq-e-Ilahi (Godâ€™s sub-spirit) and
Tifl-e-Noorie (body of Godâ€™s Light) are some supreme divine entities, and
are superior to all souls, archangels and esoteric human faculties. And like
the archangels, they are directly linked with God. Their maqam (station)
is the Alam-e-Ahdiyat (the Realm of Divine Oneness).
    </p>
    <p>
        At the age of 35, on the 15th of Ramadan, 1976, a sperm of Light (Nutfa-
e-Noor) was placed in the heart (subtlety of Qalb) of His Divine Eminence.
After some time, the Tifl-e-Noorie (body of Godâ€™s Light) was taken to
various places for spiritual learning. On the 15th of Ramadan, 1985, when
His Divine Eminence had already been assigned to the worldly duty in
Hyderabad (Pakistan), the same sperm of Light, having grown up into a Tifl-e-Noorie, was delivered permanently. Through this Tifl-e-Noorie, His
Divine Eminence was coronated in the court of Mohammad, as Sultan
(King of Spiritual Poverty â€˜Faqrâ€™). Tifl-e-Noorie is granted the rank after
12 years, however, it was awarded to His Divine Eminence in 9 years only
because of His assignment in the world.
