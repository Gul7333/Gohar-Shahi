        <h1>Teachings of His Eminence Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>His Eminence Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</strong>'s teachings are
          profound, unique, and straightforward. The essence of his message is:
          <em>"Awaken your heart's spirit and connect with God through it."</em>
          When the heart chants the name of God, Godâ€™s love automatically enters
          the heart, filling it with divine light and serenity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his book <em>"Religion of God"</em>, His Eminence begins with
          several enlightening points that highlight the principles of
          spirituality and divine connection:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The religions established through celestial scriptures are correct,
            provided they have not been adulterated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Religions are like sailboats, and the scholars are like sailors.
            Reaching the destination is difficult if either one is defective.
            However, the Saints can safely guide even damaged â€˜sailboatsâ€™ to the
            shore. People with spiritual incapacity gather around Saints for
            this reason.
          </li>
          <li>
            Godâ€™s love supersedes all religions and is the essence of every
            faith. It is the core of all religious paths, while Godâ€™s Light
            serves as the guiding lantern along the way.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are three parts of exoteric knowledge and one part of esoteric
            knowledge, and Khidr (Vishnu Maharaj) dispensed this knowledge.
            Godâ€™s love is the means of obtaining Godâ€™s nearness. Dogs are better
            than the hearts empty of Godâ€™s love because the dogs love their
            master, and this love earned them the nearness of their master.
            Otherwise an â€˜uncleanâ€™ dog and a divinely ordained human cannot be
            compared.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your desire is to achieve paradise and its rewards, then worship
            extensively and strive to reach the highest levels of heaven.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you seek union with God, then learn spirituality and follow the
            Prescribed Divine Path. Through spirituality, you may attain the
            ultimate nearness and connection with God.
          </li>
        </ol>

          <h2>
            His Eminence Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi teaches the science of producing
            divine light which purify human Heart and body
          </h2>
          <p>
            In the olden days, fire used to be produced from the method of
            rubbing stones together. The rubbing of iron objects together also
            produces a spark. The splashing of water also produces electricity.
            Similarly, in human beings the circulating blood, meaning the
            throbbing of the heart, also produces electricity. A human body
            possesses 1-1Â½ volts of electricity, which sustains agility in him.
            The electricity and agility is lessened in the old age due to the
            falling speed of throbs. Initially the heartbeats have to be made
            prominent. Aspirants have utilised various methods, such as dancing,
            sports activity, exercise-work out, and through loud chanting with
            strike of Godâ€™s name also.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the heartbeats get prominent, try to synchronise â€˜Allah Allahâ€™
            with every beat or â€˜Allahâ€™ with one heartbeat and â€˜Huâ€™ with the
            other. Place your hand on the heart sometimes, feel your heartbeats
            and try to synchronise the name â€˜Allahâ€™. Occasionally, synchronise
            â€˜Allahâ€™ with the pace of the pulse. Imagine the word â€˜Allahâ€™ is
            entering your heart. Dhikr (chanting) of â€˜Allah-Huâ€™ is better and
            more effective than that of Dhikr-Allah. Those reluctant and afraid
            of â€˜Huâ€™, instead of deprivation, they might as well synchronise just
            â€˜Allahâ€™ in their heartbeats. People of Dhakuriyah (science of Godâ€™s
            remembrance), and Wird-o-Wadhaif (verbal chanting with the rosary)
            ought to stay as clean as possible.
          </p>
          <strong
            >â€˜Those who show respect, they obtain the benevolence. And those who
            donâ€™t show respect, they remain deprived.â€™</strong
          >
          <h4>The First Method</h4>
          <p>
            On a piece of paper, write the word, â€˜Allahâ€™ with a black pen or
            pencil for as long as you feel comfortable. Do this exercise every
            day. One day, the word â€˜Allahâ€™ will begin to float before your eyes.
            Then, try to bring it in your heart from the eyes through
            visualising it.
          </p>
          <h4>The Second Method</h4>
          <p>
            Write the word â€˜Allahâ€™ in a yellow colour on a white bulb (zero
            watt, a type of bulb that we normally use at night time in
            bedrooms). Try to absorb it in your eyes by looking at it, any time
            during the day or just before you sleep. Once it is absorbed within
            your eyes, visualise it to bring it in your heart.
          </p>
          <h4>The Third Method</h4>
          <p>
            This method is suitable for those that carry out this practice under
            the guidance of a Spiritual Guide, and acquire spiritual help from
            their guide due to their spiritual relation and connection. Sit in
            isolation. Use your index finger to visualise and to write the word
            â€˜Allahâ€™ on your heart. You may as well seek help from your Spiritual
            Guide in this matter, and visualise he is holding your finger and
            writing the word â€˜Allahâ€™ on your heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practice this daily until the word â€˜Allahâ€™ is seen written on your
            heart. Through the earlier mentioned methods, â€˜Allahâ€™ is inscribed
            as seen written outside on the paper. When the word â€˜Allahâ€™ begins
            to synchronise with the heartbeats, it gradually begins to glitter.
            Since in this method help of the Spiritual Guide is available, the
            word â€˜Allahâ€™ is seen beautifully written and shining on the heart
            from the beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many Prophets and Saints came in this world. During loud chanting,
            as a test, you may visualise all Prophets and Saints, one by one.
            Whoever your destiny is attached with will appear before you. Your
            heartbeats will rise in chanting, and you will see spiritual growth
            also. Then, select him for visualisation because every Saint is
            related to a certain Prophet in the spiritual system, though a
            living Prophet is not a condition. The destiny of every devout lies
            with a certain Saint. For spiritual benevolence, the Spiritual Guide
            must be physically alive. Occasionally, some lucky aspirant is
            granted Malakutee Faiz from the Kamil Dhat (Divinely Accomplished
            Guide) who is living, but not physically; however, it is rare.
            Verily! The tombs of the departed Saints may render mundane
            benevolence. This is known as Owaisi Faiz. Owaisi Faiz is a form of
            spiritual training where the guide renders spiritual grace in dreams
            and by esoteric means, whether or not the guide is living. Aspirants
            in Owaisi Faiz are often troubled and confused by what they see in
            dreams, and Kashf (spiritual unveiling). This is because their guide
            is in Batin (Esoteric Realm), and the Satan is also in Batin, and it
            becomes so difficult to recognise who is who.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concerned knowledge is as important as the Faiz (spiritual
            grace) itself. And a living Spiritual Guide is more suitable. Faiz
            without the required knowledge will turn the aspirant into a Majzoob
            (an enlightened person who lost the intellect in Godâ€™s love). Faiz
            accompanied by Ilm (the required knowledge) turns the aspirant into
            a Mehboob (Beloved of God). Mehboob renders Dunyawee Faiz (mundane
            benevolence) and Ruhaani Faiz (spiritual grace and training) to
            people through his Ilm. Whereas the Majzoob renders Dunyawee Faiz to
            people by beating them with sticks and swearing at them.

            Religious affiliation is not mandatory; however, one must not be
            predestinedly ill-fated. A large number of people may obtain the
            grace of Godâ€™s name (initiation of the heart) from the image of His
            Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi on the Moon also. The method of
            obtaining the spiritual grace from the Moon: when the full moon is
            in the east, look at it carefully, say â€˜Allahâ€™ thrice as you see
            Gohar Shahiâ€™s picture on the Moon. And now, you are blessed! Now,
            start the exercise without any worries or fear according to the
            method mentioned here. Verily! The image of His Divine Eminence
            Gohar Shahi on the Moon has spoken with many individuals in all
            languages. You also may speak with the image on the Moon.
          </p>
