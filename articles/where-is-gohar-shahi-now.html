        important question for those who follow His teachings and love Him. The

      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        First You should know that Gohar Shahi is <strong>imortal</strong> and

        width="100%"
      />

      <h2>What is Occultation?</h2>
      <p>
        Occultation means a special kind of disappearance. It is not like death.
        His Holiness is still among us, but He is not appearing publicly for
        now. This is something He had already told His followers before
        disappearing in 2001.
      </p>

      <h2>What Did He Say Before Disappearing?</h2>
      <p>Before His disappearance, His Holiness Gohar Shahi clearly said:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>He would go into occultation (disappear from public view).</li>
        <li>He would return again in the future.</li>
        <li>
          When He returns, He will <strong>rule the world spiritually</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> will be with Him during that time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who Represents Him Now?</h2>
      <p>
        Before going into occultation, Gohar Shahi
        <strong>appointed Younus AlGohar</strong> as His
        <strong>only official representative</strong>. He clearly said:
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        ‚ÄúAnyone who wants to meet Me should go to Younus AlGohar until I
        return.‚Äù
      </div>

      <h2>What is Younus AlGohar Doing?</h2>
      <p>
        Younus AlGohar is now leading the mission of Gohar Shahi around the
        world. He teaches people about
        <strong>divine love, inner purification, and the truth</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He created a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/alratv" target="_blank"
          >YouTube channel</a
        >
        which now has over <strong>1 million subscribers</strong>. Every night,
        he goes live for more than 2 hours to answer questions and guide people
        from all religions and backgrounds.
      </p>

      <h2>Messiah Foundation International (MFI)</h2>
      <p>
        Younus AlGohar also started an organization called
        <strong>Messiah Foundation International</strong>. This foundation is
        working to spread the message of <strong>Gohar Shahi</strong> to all
        humanity. Its mission is to promote the <strong>Love of God</strong>,
        not just religion.
      </p>
      <p>
        MFI helps people spiritually, teaches them how to connect with God, and
        gives them practical teachings on how to bring peace into their lives.
      </p>

      <h2>The Message of Gohar Shahi</h2>
      <p>The message of His Holiness Gohar Shahi is simple and universal:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>God does not belong to one religion ‚Äî He belongs to everyone.</li>
        <li>You can love God even if you don‚Äôt follow any religion.</li>
        <li>
          Real connection with God starts from the heart, not from books or
          rituals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        His Holiness Gohar Shahi is <strong>alive</strong>, but in
        <strong>hiding for now</strong>. He will come back and appear publicly
        when the time is right. Until then, He has left Younus AlGohar in charge
        to guide and help people spiritually.
