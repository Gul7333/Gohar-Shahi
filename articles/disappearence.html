            <h1>
                Disappearnce of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi
              </h1>
              <p>
                His Holiness Riaz Ahmed revealed in His presence that He would disappear for some time and later reappear in this world alongside Jesus Christ. This return is destined to counter the satanic powers and reconnect humanity with God through the teachings of love and heart awakening.

              <p>
                In anticipation of His disappearance, His Holiness appointed <strong>Younus AlGohar</strong> as His Divine Eminence's Representative. He declared, "Whoever wishes to meet Gohar Shahi (Himself) should meet Younus AlGohar." This appointment was a clear directive to ensure the continuation of His divine mission.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Despite the explicit instructions and foreknowledge provided by His Holiness about His disappearance, certain individuals, including His sons and some family members, falsely declared Him dead. They constructed a tomb in His name and began collecting money from followers, exploiting His Holiness's legacy for personal gain.  
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Furthermore, they rejected the divine order of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi to follow Younus AlGohar as His Representative. Instead, they unlawfully proclaimed themselves the inheritors of His mission and continue to mislead some followers with deceptive practices.  
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Today, His Holiness's sacred mission is under the guidance and supervision of <strong>Younus AlGohar</strong> through the establishment of a new organization, <strong>Messiah Foundation International</strong>. This organization is dedicated to preserving and spreading the true teachings and mission of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed.  
              </p>
              
              <h3>Younus AlGohar</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Younus AlGohar</strong> (born: 16 June 1969) is a Representative of Gohar Shahi and co-founder of the <strong>Messiah Foundation International</strong>, also known as the Kalki Avatar Foundation and Mehdi Foundation International. This organization is dedicated to spreading the mystical teachings of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi and upholds the belief that Shahi is the prophesied Messiah (Mahdi).
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1983, at the age of 15, Younus AlGohar encountered His Divine Eminence Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi for the first time. This meeting marked the beginning of an extraordinary spiritual journey. Over the next 18 years, he remained a devoted and close disciple of His Holiness, learning directly from him and embracing his divine mission. Younus AlGohar continued to serve as a disciple until His Holinessâ€™s disappearance in 2001.  
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Younus AlGohar</strong> also manages the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/alratv"><strong>Alra TV channel</strong></a>, which is accessible on almost all major social media platforms. He goes live every night at 10:30 PM UK time, engaging with audiences worldwide. During these live sessions, people ask questions about spirituality, the secrets of divine love, and the mysteries of the universe. Younus AlGohar provides detailed and enlightening answers, drawing from the teachings of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi.  
              </p>
              <p>
                This innovative use of social media to disseminate the message of Gohar Shahi has significantly contributed to the missionâ€™s growth. It has made the teachings more accessible and relatable to a global audience, leading to increased awareness and widespread recognition of the divine mission.
              </p>
              
              <h3>
                Messiah Foundation International
              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>RAGS International</strong> was founded by His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi in 1980. In 2000, it was renamed <strong>Messiah Foundation International (MFI)</strong> to reflect the evolving scope of its divine mission. The first center for MFI was established in London, which continues to serve as the organizationâ€™s headquarters.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Since its inception, MFI has expanded globally, establishing centers in numerous countries, including Canada, the USA, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Japan, Australia, India, Greece, Thailand, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Pakistan, and Nepal. These centers are devoted to spreading the spiritual teachings of His Holiness and fostering divine love and heart awakening across the world.  
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>At this time, the only valid organization is <strong>Messiah Foundation International</strong>. All other organizations are not recognized as valid By His Divine Eminence Riaz Ahmed GOHAR Shahi.</em>
