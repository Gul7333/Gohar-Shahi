      <h1>Gohar Shahi</h1>
      <p>
        His Hollines Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi belongs to a village of Pakistan
        "Dhok Gohar Shah", which is located in City of Gujar khan, district
        Rawalpindi , province Punjab. His Hollines Real name is
        <strong>Riaz Ahmed</strong> and the suffix
        <strong>Gohar Shahi</strong> is from your family backgrounds.He is a
        fifth generation descendant of the Sufi Baba Gohar Ali Shah.
      </p>

      <p>
        His Divine Eminence developed inclination towards shrines of the Saints
        since His childhood. The father of His Divine Eminence says, â€˜At the age
        of 5-6 years, His Divine Eminence would disappear, and we would find Him
        sitting at the shrine of Nizam Uddin Auliya in New Delhi, India.
        Occasionally, it seemed to me that His Divine Eminence was talking to
        Nizam Uddin Auliya.â€™ This incident dates back to the time when the
        father of His Divine Eminence resided in Delhi for his job.
      </p>

      <p>
        When His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi visited India in March 1997, the
        caretaker of the shrine of the Saint Nizam Uddin, upon the instructions
        of the soul of Nizam Uddin Auliya, placed the â€˜Turban of Honourâ€™ on the
        head of His Divine Eminence. â€˜Since childhood, whatever His Divine
        Eminence predicted came true. Hence, I would fulfil all His reasonable
        wishes.â€™ The father of His Divine Eminence says, â€˜Gohar Shahi, as per
        His routine, comes out to the lawn in the house every morning, and I
        stand in respect to greet him.â€™ His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi
        disapproves of this, and says, â€˜I feel shy, as I am your son. So do not
        stand in respect for me.â€™ The father of His Divine Eminence says that he
        always explains that he stands in respect for the presence of God that
        dwells in His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi. Amir Hussain, a teacher from
        Mora Noorie Primary School recollects, â€˜I am famous for being a stern
        teacher in the area. I used to penalise the naughty kids. His Divine
        Eminence would sometimes reach the school late, and when I would want to
        punish His Divine Eminence, I would feel as if somebody had gotten hold
        of the stick, and I would end up smiling.â€™
