        <h1>
          About Younus AlGohar ? | Who is Younus AlGohar & What is His Mission?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Younus AlGohar is the only official representative of
          <a href="/">Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</a>. He is responsible for
          spreading the divine mission of Gohar Shahi, which is the message of
          God's love for every soul. He is also the founder of Mehdi Foundation
          International and promotes the belief that Gohar Shahi is the Promised
          Messiah, Imam Mehdi, and Kalki Avatar.
        </p>
      </header>
      <p>
        Younus AlGohar was born on 16 June 1968 in Karachi, Pakistan. His father
        was a Sunni Muslim and a small businessman. Younus AlGohar grew up in
        Karachi and was deeply religious from a very young age. However, He soon
        became disillusioned by the conflicting views of Sunni and Wahhabi
        sects, as there were two separate mosques in their town representing
        each ideology.
      </p>

      <h2>When Did Younus AlGohar Meet Gohar Shahi?</h2>
      <p>
        During 1983 , at the age of 15 He first encountered His Master Riaz
        Ahmed Gohar Shahi. He tells:
      </p>
      <p>
        One day at school, Younus AlGohar overheard his friend trying to
        convince another student to visit and learn about the teachings of Gohar
        Shahi. The other student refused, but Younus felt moved by the
        conversation. He approached his friend and said, "If heâ€™s not going, I
        will go with you instead." When Younus AlGohar met Gohar Shahi for the
        first time, he experienced a profound spiritual awakening. Just 30
        minutes after the meeting, his heart began chanting the name of God on
        its own. This moment marked the beginning of a deep and powerful
        connection with Gohar Shahi. After that, he remained a devoted follower
        of Ra Gohar Shahi, learning directly from Him and wholeheartedly
        embracing His divine mission.
      </p>

      <h2>Time Spent with Gohar Shahi</h2>
      <p>
        He spent most of his time with Gohar Shahi, traveling to different
        countries to spread the mission of God's love and heart awakening. As a
        devoted follower, he dedicated himself completely to this spiritual path
        and gained a special place in the eyes of Gohar Shahi.
      </p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        He attended Urdu Science College and later earned a Master's degree in
        Islamic Studies from the University of Karachi.
      </p>
      <p>
        He says that he received spiritual education directly from Gohar Shahi
        and also from other saints of God. With the help and guidance of Gohar
        Shahi, his inner spiritual bodies would come out and travel to spiritual
        schools, where they gained divine knowledge. During these spiritual
        journeys, he learned the teachings of the Qurâ€™an directly from Sheikh
        Abdul Qadir Jilani and even from the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). He also
        says that he has knowledge of 21 different tafaseer (interpretations) of
        the Qurâ€™an. All of this happened under the spiritual guidance and
        support of Gohar Shahi, through a process known as practical
        spiritualityâ€”where the soul and spiritual bodies leave the physical body
        and interact with holy personalities in the spiritual world.
      </p>
      <h2>Beliefs of Younus AlGohar | Younus AlGohar Aqeeda</h2>
      <p>
        Younus AlGohar shares many spiritual experiences and beliefs based on
        his personal journey and teachings received under the guidance of Riaz
        Ahmed Gohar Shahi. He says:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          He believes that Prophet Muhammad (SAW) is the last and final prophet
          of God.
        </li>

        <li>
          He has seen and met many saints, prophets, and even God (Allah), and
          has spoken with them during spiritual experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
          He has visited <strong>Aalam-e-Ghaib</strong> (the unseen realm),
          which he describes as the origin of Allah.
        </li>
        <li>
          He believes that Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi also came from Aalam-e-Ghaib
          and has a unique realm there called <strong>Riaz-ul-Jannah</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          He claims that the image of Gohar Shahi has miraculously appeared on
          the Moon, the Sun, the Black Stone, and in space, as a divine sign.
        </li>
        <li>
          He believes in practical spirituality, where the spiritual bodies of a
          person can travel to higher realms to gain divine knowledge and meet
          holy personalities.
        </li>
        <li>
          He also believes that Gohar Shahi is the Promised Messiah, Imam Mehdi,
          and Kalki Avatar for all humanity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Is Younus AlGohar Sunni or Shia?</h2>
      <p>
        Younus AlGohar does not associate himself with any sect such as Sunni or
        Shia. He strongly opposes sectarianism in Islam and emphasizes that the
        true message of Islam is unity, not division. He says that during the
        time of Prophet Muhammad (SAW), there were no sectsâ€”only one identity
        existed: the <strong>Ummati</strong> (follower of the Prophet).
        According to him, a true Ummati is one who has <em>Noor</em> (divine
        light) in the heart. He believes that on the Day of Judgment, people
        will not be identified by their sects, but by the divine light in their
        hearts. It is this Noor, he says, that will determine who is a true
        follower of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW).
      </p>
      <h2>Younus AlGohar's Mission</h2>

      <p>
        Younus AlGohar's mission is to spread the spiritual teachings and divine
        message of <strong>Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</strong>, whom he believes to
        be the <strong>Promised Imam Mehdi, Messiah, and Kalki Avatar</strong>.
        He says that clear signs from God have appeared to support this claim â€”
        such as the image of Gohar Shahi appearing on the Moon, the Sun, the
        Black Stone, and other sacred places.
        <a href="/articles/gohar-shahi-images-on-moon.html">See Pictures</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        At the core of his mission is the message of
        <strong>practical spirituality</strong>, which he learned directly from
        Gohar Shahi. This form of spirituality is not based on rituals or
        religious divisions but focuses on
        <strong>connecting the heart with God</strong>. He teaches that every
        human being, regardless of religion, can spiritually reach God through
        the awakening of the heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Younus AlGohar believes that all religions were created by the same God,
        and their true purpose is to lead people back to Him. He teaches that
        religion should never be a reason to fight or hate others. Instead, he
        promotes <strong>peace, tolerance, and divine love</strong> as the core
        message of every faith.
      </p>

      <p>
        He often says that when a person's heart is awakened with divine light
        (<em>Noor</em>), hatred and negativity leave the heart, and the love of
        God enters. This transformation makes a person naturally kind, loving,
        and compassionate â€” not just toward God, but also toward all of God's
        creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        To spread this message, Younus AlGohar runs a spiritual media channel
        called <strong>ALRA TV</strong>, which broadcasts on YouTube and other
        social media platforms. He goes live every day for about
        <strong>2.5 hours</strong>, where he answers spiritual questions from
        viewers around the world and teaches practical spirituality in a very
        open and friendly way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many people who follow his teachings claim to have had
        <strong>profound spiritual experiences</strong> â€” such as heart
        awakening, seeing divine light, and even visions of prophets and saints
        â€” after coming into contact with him or watching his sessions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Younus AlGohar emphasizes that all of this is done out of pure love for
        Gohar Shahi. He does not charge any money for his teachings, spiritual
        guidance, or time. His mission is to help people find inner peace,
        divine connection, and love for humanity.
      </p>
      <h2>Where Is Younus AlGohar Now?</h2>

      <p>

        <strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>, where he continues his

        <strong>ALRA TV</strong> and connects with followers around the world
        through daily live broadcasts, online events, and spiritual discussions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to his work in London, he frequently
        <strong>travels internationally</strong> to spread the message of divine
        love and practical spirituality. Over the years, he has visited many
        countries including
        <strong>India, Dubai (UAE), Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan</strong>
        to hold spiritual events, interfaith gatherings, and public talks.
      </p>

      <p>
        During these visits, he meets with people of all religions and
        backgrounds to share the teachings of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi. His events
