          Manifestation of His Hollines Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi Images in the
          Moon, Mars, and various other planets
        </h1>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ is symbolic to divinity, a towering personality, and
          enjoys a close relationship to God, hence, needs no formal
          introduction at all. His fame stands out. Images of Jesus Christ have
          appeared on many planets and locations. Many individuals of the
          present era are fortunate enough to have met Jesus Christ in person.
        </p>
        <p>
          His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi is also present on earth. His
          Divine Eminence is always on the move, and does not stay in one
          specific home. The images of His Divine Eminence are prominent on
          various planets including Mars. His Divine Eminence has penned some
          remarkable books on spirituality, which are available at
          www.goharshahi.com. His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi comes from
          Pakistan, and advocates spiritual sciences and Sufism.
        </p>
        <p>
          His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi says, â€˜I am neither a Prophet nor
          an apostle; nevertheless, I have the full support of Mohammad (The
          Founder of Islam), Jesus Christ (The Founder of Christianity) and many
          other Prophets.â€™
        </p>
        <p>
          His Divine Eminence says, â€˜A non-religious individual who possesses
          Godâ€™s love in his heart is better than a religious one who doesnâ€™t
          love God.â€™
        </p>
        <p>
          The Muslim clerics ask His Divine Eminence to say that the Muslims are
          the best among all. On contrary to this; His Divine Eminence says,
          â€˜The best among all is one who possesses Godâ€™s love, no matter what
          religion he belongs to.â€™
        </p>
        <p>
          The Muslim clerics say, â€˜The right of entry to the paradise is subject
          to declaration of the Muslim faith.â€™
        </p>
        <p>
          His Divine Eminence says, â€˜The souls are to enter the paradise,
          whereas the bodies will be left in this world. The enlightened souls
          will affirm the declaration of faith upon its entry to the paradise.
          Every soul will be required to affirm the declaration of faith of its
          respective Prophet and religion. And the Muslim declaration of faith
          is confined to the Muslims only.â€™
        </p>
        <p>
          One Muslim faction says, â€˜Spirituality (knowledge that deals in
          purification and enlightenment of the heart) and Sufism is all
          unholy.â€™ On contrary to this, His Divine Eminence says, â€˜Without the
          purification of the heart, all worship is unholy, insincere and a
          total waste.â€™
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Muslim faith, a soul takes one birth only. According
          to His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahiâ€™s book, â€˜The Religion of Godâ€™,
          only the celestial soul takes a single birth in this world, whereas
          the terrestrial souls may take several births in different bodies.
          Because of such beliefs of His Divine Eminence, many Muslims have
          turned hostile towards His Divine Eminence. It is because of such
          beliefs of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi that the Pakistani
          Government has banned His book. Bombs were thrown at Him on several
          occasions. Many Muslim organisations have announced rewards on his
          head. The Pakistani Government has trapped His Divine Eminence in
          false cases of blasphemy against Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
          His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi does not propagate any religion but
          advocates Divine Love, and renders practical teachings that of
          bringing God and his love in the heart. His Divine Eminence says, â€˜God
          himself will guide you once you are connected with God.â€™ Many of the
          disciples of His Divine Eminence can see Godâ€™s name written on their
          hearts while they meditate. His Divine Eminence says, â€˜Godâ€™s name in
          any language is worthy of respect, and spiritual grace can be obtained
          from its practice.â€™ People of all religions love Him. His Divine
          Eminence has delivered lectures on spirituality in mosques, Hindu
          temples, Sikh temples, and Churches in the UK, the USA, Europe,
          Africa, Middle East and Asia.

          After politicians used their influence, NASA at last acknowledged the
          existence of human images on Mars. There are images on various other
          planets, which NASA has yet concealed. NASA is still reluctant to
          verify the identity of whom the images resemble.

          In an August 8, 2001 letter to Mr Sunny Peter of the UK, NASA stated,
          â€˜On July 25, 1976, as NASAâ€™s Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the
          planet Mars photographing the surface for possible landing sites for
          its sister ship Viking 2, the spacecraft took a picture of a feature
          in the Cydonia region of the planet that resembled the shadowy
          likeness of a human face.â€™

            image of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi on the sacred stone in the
            Shiv Temple in Umar Kot (Sindh, Pakistan). <br />

            The popular Sindhi newspaper, the Daily Mehran, published the news
            of the discovery of an image of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi on
            the sacred stone within the Shiv Temple near Umar Kot in its June 6,
            1998 edition. Hindus are gathering with great affection and interest
            to see the image. A pamphlet was distributed in regards to this
            matter and subsequently the stone became a focal point for the
            masses. The Hindu Community is joyful and is celebrating the
            appearance of the image of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi.

              <strong> A Divine Phenomenon:</strong> On the right hand of His
              Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi, â€˜Mohammadâ€™ is visible. On the left
              handâ€™s fingers, the word â€˜Allahâ€™ is visible.
            </p>
            <em
              >Important Note: Some people wonder why â€˜Allahâ€™ is inscribed on
              the left handâ€™s fingers (they regard it as disrespectful for the
              name â€˜Allahâ€™ to appear on the left hand subject to its usage for
              cleaning oneself). His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi explains, â€˜I
              could be rightly accused of such an act, had I created the fingers
              myself or somehow managed to inscribe â€˜Allahâ€™ on them. For the
              best, does only Allah know whether it is a coincidence or a
              miracle of Allah.â€™</em
