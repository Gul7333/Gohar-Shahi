        village of Pakistan "Dhok Gohar Shah", which is located in City of Gujar
        khan, district Rawalpindi , province Punjab. His Hollines Real name is
        <strong>Riaz Ahmed</strong> and the suffix

      </p>
      <h3>Mysterious Birth of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</strong> graced this earth
        on 25 November 1941. His <strong>mother</strong> shared an extraordinary
        story with one of his followers about his miraculous birth. She
        recounted that <strong>Gohar Shahi</strong> was not born in the usual
        way that other children are. When asked for details, she explained that
        even before his birth, the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)
        appeared to her in a dream and said,
        <strong>"We are going to give you Riaz."</strong>

        On the day of delivery, she recalled, she was resting and suddenly felt
        the sensation of a child pushing his legs within her. She woke up and
        was astonished to see a child already present near her in the room. The
        entire experience was beyond ordinary—she did not feel any pain, as
        though it was the divine birth of someone extraordinary who had arrived
        directly from the heavens. The room was filled with an enchanting
        fragrance and a profound sense of peace. She described Riaz as someone
        unlike any other child.

        <br />
        The followers of <strong>Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</strong> firmly believe
        that his arrival on Earth was miraculous and did not involve a typical
        childbirth process. They regard Riaz as a divine personality sent to
        this universe to guide humanity and reconnect them with God.
      </p>

      <h3>Childhood of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</h3>
      <p>
        Childhood of his Holliness is very intersting and Mysterious too. From
        early age His Holliness was attention of whole village peoples. People
        used to come His Home to ask For prayer in favour of them. His Hollines
        also spent some days of his childhood life in Indian New Delhi also
        becuase of His Father posting there. In New Delhi He would often
        disappear from home and his parrent would find him near tombs of Saints.
        His Mother told that She would often reamin worried bcz of Riaz
        Disappearnce from Home . She told A Spritual Man on Horse in white
        Clothes often come and would tell Her "
        <strong>Dont Worry for Riaz,</strong> "
        <br/>
        His Hollines Riaz Ahmed Father says (taken from His Hollines book):
        <blockquote>
          His Divine Eminence developed inclination towards shrines of the Saints
since His childhood. The father of His Divine Eminence says, "At the age
of 5-6 years, His Divine Eminence would disappear, and we would find
Him sitting at the shrine of Nizam Uddin Auliya in New Delhi, India.
Occasionally, it seemed to me that His Divine Eminence was talking to
Nizam Uddin Auliya." This incident dates back to the time when the father
of His Divine Eminence resided in Delhi for his job.
        </blockquote>
      </p>
     
      <h3>Early Age Of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</h3>
      <p>
        His Holiness Gohar Shahi exhibited extraordinary humility and kindness
        from a very young age. According to his village friends, he was deeply
        considerate of all living beings, no matter how small. For instance,
        when walking along the edge of a water canal, while others might
        inadvertently step on ants or insects, His Holiness would take great
        care to avoid harming them. This compassion extended to humans as well.
        If a car or bus broke down on a road near his village, he would not
        simply ignore the stranded passengers. Instead, he would personally
        prepare food and tea and take it to the spot to assist them. Even as a
        young boy, His Holiness showed a profound commitment to helping the poor
        and those in need, demonstrating a genuine desire to ease the struggles
        of others. His actions reflected a heart full of empathy and a spirit
        devoted to service.
        <br />
        From an early age, His Holiness Gohar Shahi displayed a profound
        interest in spirituality and Sufism. He would frequently visit the tombs
        of spiritual saints, seeking solace and divine connection in these
        sacred spaces as he pursued his quest for God. In his book,
        <strong> Roohani Safar </strong> , His Holiness recounts that as he
        reached the age of puberty, his yearning to become a saint reached its
        pinnacle. However, he found no clear path to fulfill this deep desire.
        Driven by an unwavering devotion, he would spend days and nights near
        the shrine of <strong> Baba Gohar Ali Shah </strong>, immersed in the
        recitation of religious verses, hoping to uncover the spiritual truths
        he sought so fervently. His dedication during these formative years laid
        the foundation for his profound spiritual journey.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Spritual Journey of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</h3>
      <p>
        At the age of 20,
        <strong>His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</strong> embarked on his
        spiritual journey to find God. His first destination was Lal Bagh, a
        renowned Sufi site in Pakistan, where he began his search. However, his
        efforts were short-lived due to illusions and distractions caused by
        Satan. This initial failure weakened his belief in divinity and
        sainthood, leaving him disillusioned with religious scholars and Sufis.
        Disheartened, His Holiness shifted his focus to worldly life. He
        married, settled down, and had three children. For about 12 years, he
        lived a conventional life until he began experiencing profound spiritual
        dreams. In these dreams, a mysterious figure appeared, urging him to
        renounce worldly attachments and dedicate himself to religious
        practices. After about a year of these dreams, the figure gave a final
        command: to leave worldly life within three days to purify his lower
        self. In 1975, following this divine instruction, His Holiness journeyed
        to Sehwan Sharif, the shrine of Sufi Saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. His
        Holiness recounted his first night at Sehwan Sharif. While engaging in
        zikr (chanting the name of God), he fell asleep and saw a gathering of
        saints in his dream. Among them was a tall, robust man with a striking
        appearance, including a large build and long mustaches. The saint
        pointed towards him and recited a Punjabi verse:
        <strong>"Asaan haan Qalandar dewaany lajpaal dy"</strong>
        ("We are the ecstatic followers of Qalandar, the protector of the
        helpless.") From that night onward, His Holiness's heartbeat began to
        rhythmically chant the name of God. Overwhelmed with joy, he realized
        that the God he had been searching for in jungles, caves, and distant
        places had been within his own heart all along.
      </p>
      <h3>Incident in Jungle With Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi</h3>
      <p>
        His Holiness shared a remarkable incident from the Laal Bagh jungle. He
        recounted that one day, a tall, elderly man appeared and silently stared
        at him before walking towards a nearby canal. Around 3 AM, the same man
        returned. In the darkness, his eyes glowed like fire, casting an eerie
        presence. As he approached closer, His Holiness felt an intense shock
        course through his body. At that very moment, His Holiness's heartbeat
        began chanting the name of God at a rapid pace. Suddenly, a radiant
        white ball of light emerged from his chest and shot towards the old man.
        The glowing orb struck the man, causing him to step back in pain.
        Angered, the man began hurling stones at His Holiness. In this
        extraordinary moment, His Holiness saw a figure, identical to himself,
        emerge from his own body. This spiritual form stood before the tall man
        while His Holiness's physical body became invisible to him. It seemed to
        be his spiritual body—a divine manifestation. The spiritual body began
        reciting something and blew its breath towards the tall man, inflicting
        pain on him. In retaliation, the tall man recited his own verses and
        blew them back, causing discomfort to the spiritual body. This spiritual
        confrontation lasted for about 30 minutes. Eventually, flames started
        emerging from the tall man's mouth. In response, the spiritual body flew
        like a bird and perched atop a nearby palm tree. Enraged, the tall man
        threw stones, but his fiery breath and projectiles failed to reach the
        spiritual body. The tall man, consumed with anger, began climbing the
        palm tree to reach the spiritual body. However, just as he approached,
        the spiritual body soared into the sky like an eagle, leaving the tall
        man staring in disbelief and defeat. Realizing his inability to confront
        this divine entity, the tall man left the jungle, bewildered and
        anxious.

        <br />

        Following this incident, His Holiness's spiritual body began appearing
        to various people in different places. People reported seeing him in
        Sehwan, and when they came to the Laal Bagh jungle, they would also find
        him there simultaneously. This marked the emergence of nine other
        human-like figures resembling His Holiness. These spiritual forms joined
        him during zikr (chanting the name of God), during prayers, and even
        stood as protectors when he slept. They were not just passive beings;
        they actively helped those in need, assisting followers in their dreams
        or even physically appearing to guide and support them. This miraculous
        event further demonstrated the divine nature and spiritual power of His
        Holiness, strengthening the faith of those around him.
      </p>
      <h3>Leaving Jungle</h3>
      <p>
        After spending approximately three years in the jungle, His Holiness
        received a divine command from God to leave the jungle and return to
        Hyderabad. The instruction was clear: serve humanity by sharing the
        knowledge of God and helping people reconnect with the Divine. Upon
        returning to Hyderabad, His Holiness chose a serene spot near Jamshoro,
        behind the Textbook Board. There, he built a simple hut that became a
        sanctuary for those seeking solace and spiritual guidance. His Holiness
        dedicated himself to healing the emotionally distressed and purifying
        people's hearts through the practice of zikr (chanting the name of God).
        People who had previously encountered His Holiness during his time in
        Sehwan began visiting this new location to continue seeking his
        blessings and wisdom. Word of his presence spread quickly, and his
        humble hut started attracting students from universities and medical
        colleges. These young minds showed a profound interest in the spiritual
        teachings and practices of zikr that His Holiness imparted. However,
        this growing attention did not sit well with everyone. The principal of
        one of the universities, noticing the students' increasing visits, tried
        to stop them but failed to deter their determination. Frustrated, the
        principal eventually instructed his staff to dismantle the hut.
        Following these orders, the hut was torn down. Despite this setback, His
        Holiness remained unwavering in his mission. He relocated to a new place
        within Hyderabad and continued his sacred work. Undeterred by obstacles,
        he persisted in awakening people's hearts, guiding them towards a deeper
        connection with God, and spreading the message of love and divinity. His
        efforts inspired countless individuals, leaving an indelible mark on
        their spiritual journeys.

      <h3>
        Anjuman Sarfuroshan-e-Islam - First Organization of Riaz Ahmed Gohar
        Shahi
      </h3>
      <p>
        His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi, in his book <em>Roohani Safar</em>,
        shares an insightful account of how the journey of spreading the Divine
        message began and need for an organization was felt. His Hollines writes:
      </p>
      <blockquote >
        "In the beginning, when people started visiting me and showing interest,
        I thought, why not engage their services to spread this Divine message?
        At first, I approached elderly people to talk about heart zikr (chanting
        the name of God from the heart). They listened attentively and enjoyed
        the discourse, but none were willing to practice it. Then, I decided to
        reach out to the Islamic scholars. While a few nodded in agreement, the
        majority opposed this spiritual knowledge and the concept of heart
        awakening. Disheartened by their rejection, I turned my focus to the
        younger generation. Young hearts are relatively untainted compared to
        the older ones, and they not only accepted the message but also engaged
        with it practically. As a result, this Divine message of love and heart
        awakening began to spread rapidly—through mosques, streets, and bazaars.
        The number of lovers and practitioners of this message increased
        abruptly."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        To manage the growing number of followers and the widespread interest in
        this spiritual mission, His Holiness founded the
        <strong>Anjuman Sarfroshan-e-Islam Organization</strong>. Under his
        supervision, this organization played a pivotal role in awakening and
        purifying the hearts of ordinary people, elevating their spiritual
        awareness, and spreading the Divine message of love and enlightenment.
        The organization's efforts transformed countless lives, fostering a
        profound connection with God and helping individuals find peace and
        purpose through spiritual practices. Through this structured approach,
        the mission of heart awakening continued to grow and inspire people from
        all walks of life.
      </p>
      <h3>

<h3>
  Disappearnce of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi
</h3>
<p>
  His Holiness Riaz Ahmed revealed in His presence that He would disappear for some time and later reappear in this world alongside Jesus Christ. This return is destined to counter the satanic powers and reconnect humanity with God through the teachings of love and heart awakening.  
</p>

<p>
  In anticipation of His disappearance, His Holiness appointed <strong>Younus AlGohar</strong> as His Divine Eminence's Representative. He declared, "Whoever wishes to meet Gohar Shahi (Himself) should meet Younus AlGohar." This appointment was a clear directive to ensure the continuation of His divine mission.
</p>

<p>
  Despite the explicit instructions and foreknowledge provided by His Holiness about His disappearance, certain individuals, including His sons and some family members, falsely declared Him dead. They constructed a tomb in His name and began collecting money from followers, exploiting His Holiness's legacy for personal gain.  
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, they rejected the divine order of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi to follow Younus AlGohar as His Representative. Instead, they unlawfully proclaimed themselves the inheritors of His mission and continue to mislead some followers with deceptive practices.  
</p>

<p>
  Today, His Holiness's sacred mission is under the guidance and supervision of <strong>Younus AlGohar</strong> through the establishment of a new organization, <strong>Messiah Foundation International</strong>. This organization is dedicated to preserving and spreading the true teachings and mission of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed.  
</p>

<h3>Younus AlGohar</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Younus AlGohar</strong> (born: 16 June 1969) is a Representative of Gohar Shahi and co-founder of the <strong>Messiah Foundation International</strong>, also known as the Kalki Avatar Foundation and Mehdi Foundation International. This organization is dedicated to spreading the mystical teachings of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi and upholds the belief that Shahi is the prophesied Messiah (Mahdi).
</p>
<p>
  In 1983, at the age of 15, Younus AlGohar encountered His Divine Eminence Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi for the first time. This meeting marked the beginning of an extraordinary spiritual journey. Over the next 18 years, he remained a devoted and close disciple of His Holiness, learning directly from him and embracing his divine mission. Younus AlGohar continued to serve as a disciple until His Holiness’s disappearance in 2001.  
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Younus AlGohar</strong> also manages the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/alratv"><strong>Alra TV channel</strong></a>, which is accessible on almost all major social media platforms. He goes live every night at 10:30 PM UK time, engaging with audiences worldwide. During these live sessions, people ask questions about spirituality, the secrets of divine love, and the mysteries of the universe. Younus AlGohar provides detailed and enlightening answers, drawing from the teachings of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi.  
</p>
<p>
  This innovative use of social media to disseminate the message of Gohar Shahi has significantly contributed to the mission’s growth. It has made the teachings more accessible and relatable to a global audience, leading to increased awareness and widespread recognition of the divine mission.
</p>

<h3>
  Messiah Foundation International
</h3>
<p>
  <strong>RAGS International</strong> was founded by His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi in 1980. In 2000, it was renamed <strong>Messiah Foundation International (MFI)</strong> to reflect the evolving scope of its divine mission. The first center for MFI was established in London, which continues to serve as the organization’s headquarters.

<h3>Remarks of the family members and friends of
  His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi</h3>
  <blockquote>
    We never saw His Divine Eminence arguing, fighting or beating up
anybody. If any of His friends was angry and wanted to get physical, His
Divine Eminence would simply smile.’
  </blockquote>
 <h3>Remarks by wife of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi</h3>
 <blockquote>
  ‘Firstly, His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi is hardly ever angry, however,
His Divine Eminence expresses intense reactions against immorality and
indecency. His Divine Eminence is exceptionally generous. In the morning
when His Divine Eminence leaves for the meeting with daily visitors in
the lawn of the house, His pockets are full of money. However, when His
Divine Eminence returns, the pockets are empty. His Divine Eminence
gives away all the money to the needy. When I am in need of money, His
Divine Eminence shows an innocent face, thus I get angry. Looking at His
innocent face, I say a couplet, “Thou art so generous by heart, but parted
with all the wealth. ”’
 </blockquote>
 <h3>Remarks by the Mother of His Divine
  Eminence Gohar Shahi</h3>
  <blockquote>
    ‘During His childhood, when He would not go to school for a day or two,
or if He suffered a business loss later in life, I would criticise Him, but He
would never raise His head in response. My Spiritual Guide, Kakka Miyan
from the village of Shams, would advise me, “Do not swear at Riaz. You
do not know what I see in Him.” He has so much sympathy for humanity
that when He would find out that a passenger bus had broken down even
at a distance of 10 miles, He would get food pre
  </blockquote>
  <h3>
    Remarks by Mohammad Iqbal of Fazooliyan, a close
friend of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi:
  </h3>
  <blockquote>
    Mohammad Iqbal says, ‘In the rainy season, as we would walk through
the fields, we would walk on the trail, and countless ants also would be
crawling there. We did not care about them, but His Divine Eminence
Ra Gohar Shahi would always avoid walking on the trail, lest the ants
are harmed or run over. His Divine Eminence would prefer to wade in
the mud instead. When a false case of murder was instigated against His
Divine Eminence, Qaddous Shiekh of the crime branch (of the police
department) came for inquiry. The residents of the area told him, “We
don’t think His Divine Eminence would have ever killed a mosquito, let
alone a human being!”’
