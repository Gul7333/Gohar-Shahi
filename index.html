            Souls(Scientist) , from reading structure of Atom to Reaching Stars.
            Finding the Entity Who is Behind this All Gigantic Universe. Still
            No one of These Souls have Ever seen a glimpse of GOD .
            <strong>But Why</strong> <br />
            <br />
            <strong
              >This was the Question Which
              <span class="prominent-Text">Gohar Shahi</span> Answered</strong

            Gohar Shahi said Human have been finding GOD Through wrong routes,
            God doesn't Live in Forests, God doesn't lives in Mountains, God
            doesn't Live in Mosques, God doesn't Live in Churches, God Doesn't
            Lives in Mandar, not in atoms nor in stars,<strong>
              God Lives in Heart of Every Human, And The only way to reach GOD
              is through Heart</strong
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong class="prominent-Text">But How?</strong> <br />
            <strong>Gohar Shahi gave three step to Follow:</strong> <br />
          </p>
          <li>
            First You should know that, Human heart can Chant the Name of God,
            yes ,Only The name of God,.
          </li>
          <li>
            According to His Holiness Gohar Shahi <strong>ALLAH</strong> is the
            original name of God , So Try Chanting ALLAH with your Heart Beat,
            Eventually Your Heart will Start chanting name of GOD(ALLAH).
          </li>
          <li>
            But wait Your Heart would Chant The name of God , only if You have
            permission from God. God would not come to this earth to Give you
            permission, He sent Gohar Shahi to give you permission on behalf of
            him. You just have to say Word ALLAH with Sarkar Gohar Shahi Voice
