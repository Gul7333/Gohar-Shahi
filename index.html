      <p>
        <strong>Gohar Shahi</strong> is the most awaited personality . Every
        religion have given Gohar Shahi different names , and teached its
        follower to wait for His Arrival. <br />
        Muslims &#x21E5; Imam Mehdi <br />

        Hinduism &#x21E5; prem Avator <br />

        <strong

        <br />
        He is the Person who came to Earth to save human, Give them the
        Knowledge of GOD which they were seeking for million of years.
        <br />
        Hundred of Thousands Died in search of GOD, Thousands get Lost in way to
        GOD, Thousands of Human Spent their Life's in Mountains, Forests, and
        Left every thing of their lives, to Know God , to Get a single view of
        GOD. <br />
        Now In this era , Trillion of Dollor are being spent by Curious
        Souls(Scientist) , from reading structure of Atom to Reaching Stars.
        Finding the Entity Who is Behind this All Gigantic Universe. Still No
        one of These Souls have Ever seen a glimpse of GOD .
        <strong>But Why</strong> <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >This was the Question Which
          <span style="color: blue">Gohar Shahi</span> Answered</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        Gohar Shahi said Human have been finding GOD Through wrong routes, God
        doesn't Live in Forests, God doesn't lives in Mountains, God doesn't
        Live in Mosques, God doesn't Live in Churches, God Doesn't Lives in
        Mandar, not in atoms nor in stars,<strong>
          God Lives in Heart of Every Human, And The only way to reach GOD is
          through Heart</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong style="color: blue">But How?</strong> <br />
        <strong>Gohar Shahi gave three step to Follow:</strong> <br />
      </p>
      <li>
        First You should know that, Your heart can Chant the Name of God, Yes
        ,Only name of God, and what ever name it start to chant ,it will be name
        of God., So Have believe in this.
      </li>
      <li>
        According to Gohar Shahi <strong>ALLAH</strong> is the original name of
        God , So Try Chanting ALLAH with your Heart Beat, Eventually Your Heart
        will Start chanting name of GOD(ALLAH).
      </li>
      <li>
        But wait Your Heart would Chant The name of God , only if You have
        permission from God. God would not come to this earth to Give you
        permission, He sent Gohar Shahi to give you permission on behalf of him.
        You just have to say Word ALLAH with Sarkar Gohar Shahi Voice.
        <strong>[<a href="#">Say Here</a>]</strong> <br />
      </li>

      <br />
      <p>
        <strong style="color: blue"
          >Now you have Exclusive Permission from God to do this
          practice</strong
        ><br />
        <em>
          Sit and feel Your Heart Beat, You can place your hand on chest or any
          vein. Close your eyes and Focus on your Heart and Try saying the word
          ALLAH with every heart beat silenty for 5-7minutes. Do this practice
          for at least Three Days.
        </em>
        <br />

        <br />
        When Your Heart will start Chanting the Name of God , The Distance
        between you and God will decrease day by day, and one day you will See
        God Before your Eyes.After that
        <strong>God image would be engraved on your Heart</strong> , And When
        ever You would close your Eyes , God will be visible in Your Heart.
        <br />
        <br />
